# Glaukoma Reader
GUI reader developed for the Universitätsklinik Würzburg to convert hand written glaukoma graphs
(Tagesdruckkurven) to csv. The program depends on the specific form used by German Universitätskliniken.

Best results can be achieved by scanning the entire image and ensuring that nothing is blocked or
cut off.

#Technologies
* Python 3.7.9
* Tensorflow 2.3
* Tesseract 4.1.1

## Getting Started
### Requirements
Python 3.7.9 and all dependences listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). Furthermore, for
development Tesseract and Tensorflow need to be installed.
Documentation of the program can be found [here](docs/_build/html/index.html).

### Installation
Currently, only MacOS is supported. The program can be used by running [TBD](). The user guide (German only) can be found [here](Benutzerhandbuch.pdf).
